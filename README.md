The Kickstarter landing page was created for the Crazybaby company. The landing page contains information about the company, its innovative products, the benefits of these products and devices, reviews and product specifications.

The landing page was created according to [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/Ujp7bCFuvuJlkn8TSbQPSZ/Kickstarter_FE-students?type=design&node-id=19655-32&mode=design&t=fGSiCKf5KADyyzw8-0).

When creating the landing page, i used HTML, SCSS, BEM. 

That is my [DEMO LINK](https://teerveet.github.io/kickstarter-landing/).
